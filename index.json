Most of these efforts have focused on mutations in protein-coding sequences. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) strongly suggests that variants important to human diseases often lie in non-coding regions. Extending DNM-based approaches to non-coding sequences is challenging, however, because the functional significance of non-coding mutations is difficult to predict. We propose a statistical framework for analyzing DNMs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. This method, TADA-Annotations (TADA-A), is a major advance of the TADA method we developed earlier for DNM analysis in coding regions. TADA-A is able to incorporate many functional annotations such as conservation and enhancer marks, to learn from data which annotations are informative of pathogenic mutations, and to combine both coding and non-coding mutations at the gene level to detect risk genes. It also supports meta-analysis of multiple DNM studies, while adjusting for study-specific technical effects. We applied TADA-A to WGS data of 300 autism-affected family trios across five studies and discovered several autism risk genes. The software is freely available for all research uses.","tags":null,"title":"A Statistical Framework for Mapping Risk Genes from De Novo Mutations in Whole-Genome-Sequencing Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuwen Liu","Shan Yu","Vineet K.

Recent efforts have led to the development of powerful tools for enhancer quantification. However, because of genome size and complexity, these tools have yet to be applied to the whole human genome.\n**Results**: In the current study, we use a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP as a model to perform whole human genome STARR-seq (WHG-STARR-seq) to reliably obtain an assessment of enhancer activity. This approach builds upon previously developed STARR-seq in the fly genome and CapSTARR-seq techniques in targeted human genomic regions. With an improved library preparation strategy, our approach greatly increases the library complexity per unit of starting material, which makes it feasible and cost-effective to explore the landscape of regulatory activity in the much larger human genome. In addition to our ability to identify active, accessible enhancers located in open chromatin regions, we can also detect sequences with the potential for enhancer activity that are located in inaccessible, closed chromatin regions. When treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A, genes nearby this latter class of enhancers are up-regulated, demonstrating the potential for endogenous functionality of these regulatory elements.\n**Conclusion**: WHG-STARR-seq provides an improved approach to current pipelines for analysis of high complexity genomes to gain a better understanding of the intricacies of transcriptional regulation.","tags":null,"title":"Functional assessment of human enhancer activities using whole-genome STARR-sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Song Liu","Yuwen Liu","Qin Zhang","Jiayu Wu","Junbo Liang","Shan Yu","Gong-Hong Wei","Kevin P.

To systematically identify the SNPs that affect gene expression by modulating activities of distal regulatory elements, we adapt the self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) strategy, a high-throughput technique to functionally quantify enhancer activities.\n\nResults: From 10,673 SNPs linked with 996 cancer risk-associated SNPs identified in previous GWAS studies, we identify 575 SNPs in the fragments that positively regulate gene expression, and 758 SNPs in the fragments with negative regulatory activities. Among them, 70 variants are regulatory variants for which the two alleles confer different regulatory activities. We analyze in depth two regulatory variants—breast cancer risk SNP rs11055880 and leukemia risk-associated SNP rs12142375—and demonstrate their endogenous regulatory activities on expression of ATF7IP and PDE4B genes, respectively, using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach.\n\nConclusions: By identifying regulatory variants associated with cancer susceptibility and studying their molecular functions, we hope to help the interpretation of GWAS results and provide improved information for cancer risk assessment.","tags":null,"title":"Systematic identification of regulatory variants associated with cancer risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuwen Liu","Jie Zhou","Kevin P.

Many RNA-seq studies have used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources.\nResults: We show the explicit trade-off between more biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the human cell line MCF7, adding more sequencing depth after 10 M reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes, whereas adding biological replicates improves power significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of large-scale RNAseq DE studies. Our analysis showed that sequencing less reads and performing more biological replication is an effective strategy to increase power and accuracy in large-scale differential expression RNAseq studies, and provided new insights into efficient experiment design of RNA-seq studies.","tags":null,"title":"RNA-seq differential expression studies: more sequence or more replication?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" BACKGROUND\n 香港中文大学，基因组学与生物信息学，硕士 南京农业大学，农学，学士   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"99de4666cfd2250a1e9a978aa433ae52","permalink":"/software/%E4%BB%98%E9%98%B3/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/%E4%BB%98%E9%98%B3/","section":"Software","summary":"科研助理","tags":["科研助理"],"title":"付阳","type":"Software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"BACKGROUND\n​ 2019.01至今：中国农业科学院农业基因组研究所，动物基因组中心研究员、课题组组长、博导；华中农业大学深圳营养与健康研究院，博导\n 2014.08 - 2018.07：芝加哥大学，人类遗传学，博士后 2006.09 - 2014.06：芝加哥大学，发育生物学，博士 2002.09 - 2006.06：清华大学，生物科学与技术，学士  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d3a0afea9189038cd6542cb5fab3790a","permalink":"/software/%E5%88%98%E6%AF%93%E6%96%87/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/%E5%88%98%E6%AF%93%E6%96%87/","section":"Software","summary":"研究员，博导","tags":["研究员"],"title":"刘毓文","type":"Software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" BACKGROUND\n 河南大学、深圳基因组所，联合培养硕士在读 沈阳农业大学，生物科学技术学院，生物技术，学士   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d0a0beb1387852dcdc4ed6d037506ce6","permalink":"/software/%E5%BC%A0%E5%9C%86%E5%9C%86/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/%E5%BC%A0%E5%9C%86%E5%9C%86/","section":"Software","summary":"硕士","tags":["硕士"],"title":"张圆圆","type":"Software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" BACKGROUND\n 本硕博毕业于西北农林科技大学 动物遗传育种与繁殖，博士；动物学，硕士；动物科学，学士   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7ee964a0fb0b1b93d049977cdf4ae663","permalink":"/software/%E5%BC%A0%E6%9D%BE/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/%E5%BC%A0%E6%9D%BE/","section":"Software","summary":"博后","tags":["博后"],"title":"张松","type":"Software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" BACKGROUND\n 华中农大-深圳基因组所，联合培养博士在读 华中农业大学，动物遗传育种与繁殖，农学硕士 湖南农业大学，动物科学，农学学士   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"eb6c4b5b9bae34629365b13decac871f","permalink":"/software/%E7%8E%8B%E8%B6%85/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/%E7%8E%8B%E8%B6%85/","section":"Software","summary":"博士","tags":["博士"],"title":"王超","type":"Software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" BACKGROUND\n 吉林农业大学，农业昆虫与害虫防治，硕士 山东农业大学，农业资源与环境，学士   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c4db0023e3d942d0783e5f322b5fee0d","permalink":"/software/%E9%83%91%E4%BC%9F%E5%88%9A/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/%E9%83%91%E4%BC%9F%E5%88%9A/","section":"Software","summary":"科研助理","tags":["科研助理"],"title":"郑伟刚","type":"Software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" BACKGROUND\n 华中农业大学、深圳基因组研究所，联合培养硕士在读 内蒙古民族大学，动物科学，学士   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"78db743ff2e9210e3b74ea06c27b07b5","permalink":"/software/%E9%99%88%E7%95%B4%E9%9C%96/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/%E9%99%88%E7%95%B4%E9%9C%96/","section":"Software","summary":"硕士","tags":["硕士"],"title":"陈畴霖","type":"Software"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" BACKGROUND\n 本硕博毕业于西北农林科技大学 生命科学学院，生物信息学，硕博；信息与计算科学，学士   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f0d5ab83e3c76a58f4c2a4fd7510db4e","permalink":"/software/%E9%A9%AC%E6%96%87%E9%BE%99/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/%E9%A9%AC%E6%96%87%E9%BE%99/","section":"Software","summary":"博后","tags":["博后"],"title":"马文龙","type":"Software"}]
